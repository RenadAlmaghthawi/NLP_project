# Fake News Classifier 

##  Project Overview

This project is a classifier model built to classify news articles as 'Real' or 'Fake' using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model utilizes machine learning and deep learning approaches to distinguish between real and fake news articles accurately.

##  Models & Performance

The project tests various models and feature extraction techniques. The top-performing models are:

| Model              | Feature Extraction | Accuracy |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | TF-IDF | **99.45%** |
| Kim's CNN | Word2Vec | **99.89%** |

## Dataset Details

The dataset is stored in the `dataset/` folder and includes the following columns:

* label: 0 for Fake news, 1 for Real news.

* title: The headline of the article.

* text: The full content of the article.

* subject: The category of the article (e.g., Politics, Technology, etc.).

* date: The publication date of the article.
